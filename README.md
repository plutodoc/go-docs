**Go** is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed
at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically
similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing,
and CSP-style concurrency. It is often referred to as **Golang** because of its
former domain name, `golang.org`, but its proper name is Go.
